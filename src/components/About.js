      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a dedicated Full Stack Developer with a diverse skill set, spanning
        front-end and back-end technologies, machine learning, and application
        development. On the front-end, I bring expertise in HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, JQuery, and modern libraries like React, enabling me to
        craft dynamic, user-friendly interfaces. For back-end development, I am
        proficient in Python, Django, Node.js, Express.js, PHP, Laravel, C, C++,
        C#, Java, and database technologies such as SQL and MongoDB, ensuring
        robust and efficient server-side architecture.
      
      
        My passion for innovation extends to the field of machine learning,
        where I leverage tools like Python, R Programming, and MATLab to build
        intelligent systems and predictive models.
      </p>
      <p>
        This background allows me to integrate machine learning capabilities
        into applications, enhancing their functionality and user experience.
        Additionally, I have experience in mobile application development using
        Kotlin, enabling me to design and develop high-performance apps for
        Android platforms. With a focus on writing clean, maintainable code and
        solving complex problems, I strive to deliver high-quality solutions
        that meet both client and user needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        By combining technical versatility with a drive for continuous learning,
        I aim to create impactful software that bridges the gap between
        functionality and innovation.
